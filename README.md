# Salomé Macquet

I'm a French artist, designer and coder. I graduated from the École nationale supérieure des Arts décoratifs in Paris in mid-2016, where I started to draw the concept of time. I now pursues research focused on time and its relationship within physics, political & social sciences through speculative design, graphic design and performance.

In addition to independent research projects, I have been working on commissioned projects for cultural institutions, science & tech companies, architectural firms… Scope includes designing books, websites, identities, typefaces and posters as well as coding websites and algorithms.
